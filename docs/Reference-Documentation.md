Red Hat Process Automation Manager
----------------------------------
Red Hat Process Automation Manager (i.e. RHPAM) is the commercial version of jBPM. RHPAM is built on the same technology as jBPM but contains distinct features and functionality. RHPAM documentation can be used to supplement documentation found at [jBPM.org](https://www.jbpm.org/) but will require you to adapt the information for use with jBPM.
