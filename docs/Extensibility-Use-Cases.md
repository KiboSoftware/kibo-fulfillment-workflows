# Extensibility Use Cases

* [In a BPM workflow, call another REST service synchronously](#in-a-bpm-workflow-call-another-rest-service-synchronously)
* [In a BPM workflow, call another REST service asynchronously](#in-a-bpm-workflow-call-another-rest-service-asynchronously)
* [In a BPM workflow, signal to advance when stopped at a user task](#in-a-bpm-workflow-signal-to-advance-when-stopped-at-a-user-task)

# In a BPM workflow, call another REST service synchronously

This use case will illustrate how to call an external REST service *synchronously* and use the response data to make flow decisions as well as provide input to subsequent steps in the process.

You will add functionality for calling an external weather service to get a maximum temperature forecast for a given destination ZIP code. The service response data will be used to decide subsequent tasks to be executed based on a given threshold. If the maximum temperature forecast exceeds the threshold, the shipment will be directed to Customer Service; otherwise, the data will simply be provided to the person preparing the shipment, allowing them to decide on suitable packaging or shipping options. Required process instance variables will be initialized with user input received for the __Accept Shipment__ task.

You can use the pre-installed [REST Work Item Handler](https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm/blob/master/jbpm-workitems/jbpm-workitems-rest/src/main/java/org/jbpm/process/workitem/rest/RESTWorkItemHandler.java) to add external REST API calls to a jBPM business process or workflow. The following steps will guide you through general setup of your custom project and implementation of the above described custom REST call via jBPM Business Central.

The resulting custom fulfillment workflow:

## Setup your project to use the REST work item task and handler

The following general project setup will allow you to use the __Rest__ work item within any of your custom Kibo Fulfillment Workflows.

1. Log in to jBPM Business Central.

1. Open your custom project.

1. Navigate to *Settings > Custom Tasks*.

1. Within *Service Tasks*, click the __Rest__ service task __Install__ button to enable its use within the designer.

1. Move content from the generated `Rest.wid` file to the `WorkDefinitions.wid` file. Replace any existing __"Rest"__ definition within `WorkDefinitions.wid`, save your changes and then delete the `Rest.wid` file/asset.

    Example __Rest__ work item definition:
    ```
      [
        "name" : "Rest",
        "displayName" : "Rest",
        "category" : "jbpm-workitems-rest",
        "description" : "",
        "defaultHandler" : "mvel: new org.jbpm.process.workitem.rest.RESTWorkItemHandler()",
        "documentation" : "jbpm-workitems-rest/index.html",
    
        "parameters" : [
          "ConnectTimeout" : new StringDataType()
          ,"ResultClass" : new StringDataType()
          ,"ContentType" : new StringDataType()
          ,"AcceptCharset" : new StringDataType()
          ,"Headers" : new StringDataType()
          ,"AuthUrl" : new StringDataType()
          ,"Method" : new StringDataType()
          ,"ReadTimeout" : new StringDataType()
          ,"Url" : new StringDataType()
          ,"ContentTypeCharset" : new StringDataType()
          ,"HandleResponseErrors" : new StringDataType()
          ,"ContentData" : new StringDataType()
          ,"Username" : new StringDataType()
          ,"Content" : new StringDataType()
          ,"AcceptHeader" : new StringDataType()
          ,"AuthType" : new StringDataType()
          ,"Password" : new StringDataType()
        ],
        "results" : [
          "Result" : new StringDataType()
        ],
        "mavenDependencies" : [
          "org.jbpm:jbpm-workitems-rest:7.26.0.Final"
        ],
        "icon" : "Rest.png"
      ]
    ```

1. Register the __REST Work Item Handler__.

    Each defined work item, or service task, is backed by a corresponding work item handler. Registering a work item handler will update the project deployment descriptor with the appropriate initialization code. 

    Navigate to *Settings > Deployments > Work Item Handlers*, click __Add Work Item Handler__ and enter the following:
    
    * __Name:__ `Rest`
    * __Value:__ `new org.jbpm.process.workitem.rest.RESTWorkItemHandler("", "")`
    * __Resolver:__ `MVEL`
    
    __NOTE:__
    > The name attribute assigned to the work item handler must match the name of the work item definition in order for the handler to be triggered upon work item execution.

1. Save your new settings.

1. Confirm that your project deployment descriptor file has been updated appropriately.

    The file can be found here: `YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/src/main/resources/META-INF/kie-deployment-descriptor.xml`

    The content should appear similar to the following example:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <deployment-descriptor xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.jboss.org/jbpm deployment-descriptor.xsd" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">

## Create a custom Kibo Fulfillment Workflow

This example customization will illustrate use of the __Rest__ work item within a workflow to enable data-driven decisions and task updates. You will be creating a custom Ship-To-Home fulfillment process which leverages the __Rest__ work item and handler to make external calls to the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

Before proceeding, please [sign up](https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up) for a free OpenWeather account in order to get a valid API key.

1. Within your custom project, open the __[FulfillmentProcess-STH](https://github.com/Kibo-UCP/Kibo.FulfillmentWorkflows/blob/develop/src/main/resources/com/kibocommerce/bpm/fulfillment/FulfillmentProcess-STH.bpmn)__ workflow.

1. Click the __Copy__ button, provide a new name and select your custom package:

    * __New Name:__ YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME
    * __Package:__ YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY
    
1. Close the design view of the __[FulfillmentProcess-STH](https://github.com/Kibo-UCP/Kibo.FulfillmentWorkflows/blob/develop/src/main/resources/com/kibocommerce/bpm/fulfillment/FulfillmentProcess-STH.bpmn)__ workflow and open the new __YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__ workflow.

1. Within the design view of __YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__, change the process *Name*, *ID* and *Package* properties.

    Set the following in the *Process > Properties* editor:
    
    * __Name:__ YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME
    * __ID:__ YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY.YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME
    * __Package:__ YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY

1. Add the following process variables in the *Process Data* section of the *Process > Properties* editor:

    __Process Variables__
    
    Name | Data Type 
    ---- | ---------
    `destTempMax` | `Integer`
    `destTempMaxThreshold` | `Integer`
    `destZip` | `String`
    `forecastResult` | `java.util.Map`
    `openweatherAppId` | `String`

1. Add the following data outputs and assignments to the __Accept Shipment__ human task:

    __Accept Shipment Data I/O__
    
    __Data Outputs and Assignments__
    
    Name | Data Type | Target
    ---- | --------- | ------
    `destZip` | `String` | `destZip`
    `destTempMaxThreshold` | `Integer` | `destTempMaxThreshold`
    `openweatherAppId` | `String` | `openweatherAppId`

1. You will be using a Java snippet when you implement the __Rest__ task. Add the following process level data-type imports to avoid using fully qualified class names in script areas.

    Add the following class names in the *Imports > Data Type Imports* section of the *Process > Properties* editor:

    __Data Type Imports__
    
    Class Name |
    ---------- |
    `java.util.List` |
    `java.util.Map` |
    `java.util.LinkedHashMap` |
    `java.lang.Math` |
    
    __Tip:__
    > The [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) JSON parser is a provided dependency. If you wish to use `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` or any other class without the fully qualified class name in scripts, add the class to process data type imports.

1. From the *Service Tasks* section of the toolbar panel, drag the __Rest__ work item or service task onto the process design canvas. It should be located under the *JBPM-WORKITEMS-REST* category.

1. Configure the __Rest__ work item task and add Java code to the __On Exit Action__.

    * Select the newly placed __Rest__ work item task
    * Name the new task: __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__
    * Set the following parameters within the *Data Assignments* section of the task properties editor:
    
    __Rest Data I/O__
    
    __Data Inputs and Assignments__
    
    Name | Data Type | Source
    ---- | --------- | ------
    `AcceptHeader` | `String` | Constant ... `application/json`
    `Method` | `String` | Constant ... `GET`
    `ResultClass` | `String` | Constant ... `java.util.LinkedHashMap`
    `Url` | `String` | Constant ... `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?zip=#{destZip},us&APPID=#{openweatherAppId}&units=imperial`
    
    __Data Outputs and Assignments__
    
    Name | Data Type | Target
    ---- | --------- | ------
    `Result` | Custom ... `java.util.LinkedHashMap` | `forecastResult`
    
    __Tip:__
    > In the example above, notice the value of the `Url` parameter. First of all, instead of using a constant, the entire string value could be set in a process variable and referenced here. Secondly, you may inject process variable values into hard-coded string expressions using syntax like: `#{expression}`. The `zip` and `APPID` query parameters within the `Url` value are using expressions `#{destZip}` and `#{openweatherAppId}`. This can be a very useful tool for process design and is used here for substring replacement. This may be done elsewhere for process and task variables, task descriptions, diverging gateway output flow conditions, signal references, etc. 

    * Expand the *Implementation/Execution* section of the task properties editor.
    * Add the following Java snippet to the __On Exit Action__ and select `java` as the language:
    
        ```
        Map _forecastResult = (Map) kcontext.getVariable("forecastResult");
        List<Map> forecastList = (List<Map>) _forecastResult.get("list");
        Integer _destTempMax = null;
        for (Map f : forecastList) {
            Map main = (Map) f.get("main");
            Object _tempMax = (main != null) ? main.get("temp_max") : null;
            Integer tempMax = (_tempMax != null) ? (int) Math.ceil(Double.parseDouble(_tempMax.toString())) : null;
            if (tempMax != null && (_destTempMax == null || _destTempMax < tempMax)) {
                _destTempMax = tempMax;
            }
        }
        kcontext.setVariable("destTempMax", _destTempMax);
        ```

1. With the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task implemented, you can add new branches to your workflow in order to leverage its functionality.

    * Add a new __Exclusive Gateway__ (g1) between the __Converging Exclusive Gateway__ (g0), and the __Prepare for Shipment__ task.
    * Change the existing sequence flow from entering the __Prepare for Shipment__ task to instead enter the new __Exclusive Gateway__ (g1).
    * Add a new sequence flow from the new __Exclusive Gateway__ (g1) to the new __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task and set its *Implementation/Execution > Condition Expression* to use the following Java snippet:
    
        ```
        return kcontext.getVariable("destZip") != null && kcontext.getVariable("destTempMaxThreshold") != null;
        ```

    * Add two new __Exclusive Gateways__ (g2 & g3) between the new __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task, and the __Prepare for Shipment__ task.
    * Add a sequence flow from the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task to the second of the new __Exclusive Gateways__ (g2).
    * Add a sequence flow from the second to the third of the new __Exclusive Gateways__ (g2 --> g3).
    * Add a sequence flow from the third new __Exclusive Gateway__ (g3) to the __Prepare for Shipment__ task.
    * Add a new __End Signal__ event below the second of the new __Exclusive Gateways__ (g2).
    * Have the new __End Signal__ event send the `customer_care` signal, with a signal scope of `Process Instance`.
    * Add a new sequence flow from the second of the new __Exclusive Gateways__ (g2) to the new __End Signal__ event and set its *Implementation/Execution > Condition Expression* to use the following Java snippet:
    
        ```
        Integer _destTempMax = (Integer) kcontext.getVariable("destTempMax");
        Integer _destTempMaxThreshold = (Integer) kcontext.getVariable("destTempMaxThreshold");
        return _destTempMax == null || (_destTempMax != null && _destTempMax >= _destTempMaxThreshold);
        ```

    * Add a new sequence flow from new __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ (g1) to new __Converging Exclusive Gateway__ (g3).
    * Change the default route of the new __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ (g1) to be `Exclusive`.
    * Change the default route of the new __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ (g2) to be `Exclusive`.

1. Use service response data as input to another step in the process.

    * Select the __Prepare for Shipment__ human task and open the task properties editor.
    * Open the *Implementation/Execution > Assignments* section of the task properties editor and add two new data input assignments:
        
        __Prepare for Shipment Data I/O__
        
        __Data Inputs and Assignments__
        
        Name | Data Type | Source
        ---- | --------- | ------
        `destTempMaxForecast_In` | `Integer` | `destTempMax`
        `destTempMaxThreshold_In` | `Integer` | `destTempMaxThreshold`

    * These variables may now be used to populate corresponding form fields in a custom Kibo Fulfiller frontend.

1. Save your process changes and close the design view.

1. Deploy your custom project and test creating a new instance of process with ID: __YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY.YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__.

1. Once you have a new process instance created, advance the workflow until the __Print Packing Slip__ human task has been completed.

1. Navigate to the *Menu > Manage > Process Instances* section of Business Central.

    * Once redirected to the *Manage Process Instances* section of Business Central, click your process instance entry to open a detailed view.
    * From the process instance detail view, select __Diagram__ and review the current state of workflow execution.
    * If the value of the `destTempMaxThreshold` process instance variable is greater than the value of `destTempMax`, the next active task should now be the __Prepare for Shipment__ task.
    * From the process instance detail view, select __Process Variables__ to review currently assigned variable values.
    
1. Start the __Prepare for Shipment__ task and notice the following data inputs:

    * __DestTempMaxForecast_In__: *value should match that of the `destTempMax` process instance variable*
    * __DestTempMaxThreshold_In__: *value should match that of the `destTempMaxThreshold` process instance variable*

# In a BPM workflow, call another REST service asynchronously

This use case will illustrate how to call an external REST service *asynchronously* and use the response data to make flow decisions as well as provide input to subsequent steps in the process.

You will be building on the custom Kibo Fulfillment process implemented in the section entitled, "[In a BPM workflow, call another REST service synchronously](#in-a-bpm-workflow-call-another-rest-service-synchronously)." If you have not already completed that exercise, please do so before proceeding.

Asynchronous work can be achieved in multiple ways with jBPM. A simple approach could be adding a parallel gateway to your workflow, introducing logically asynchronous branches which start executing near instantaneously. For low-level control, custom work item handlers can be implemented using Java's built-in asynchronous programming features or third-party libraries. You can review the jBPM documentation on [concurrency and asynchronous execution](https://docs.jboss.org/jbpm/release/latest/jbpm-docs/html_single/#_jbpmasyncexecution) for detailed alternatives.

__NOTE:__
> For Kibo Fulfillment workflows, low-level approaches would need to be carefully designed and approved for use in a production environment.

The jBPM Executor is an out-of-box asynchronous support option which leverages the Java Executor framework and a distributed scheduler. Workflow tasks can be marked as asynchronous using the `Is Async` checkbox within the *Implementation/Execution* section of the task properties editor. With this pre-configured service-level support in place, when the flow of execution reaches a `Is Async` task, a corresponding job will be scheduled which ultimately runs work item specific handler operations in a separate thread. This will be the focus of the exercise.

The following assumes you have already [setup your project with the REST work item handler](#setup-your-project-to-use-the-rest-work-item-task-and-handler) and [created a custom Kibo Fulfillment Workflow](#create-a-custom-kibo-fulfillment-workflow) which makes a *synchronous* REST call. 

The resulting custom fulfillment workflow:

![Example custom fulfillment workflow async](/docs/images/example_custom_workflow_calling_weather_api_async.png)

## Create a custom Kibo Fulfillment Workflow using an asynchronous task

This example customization will illustrate use of the __Rest__ work item within a workflow to enable data-driven decisions and task updates. You will be creating another custom Ship-To-Home fulfillment process which leverages the __Rest__ work item and handler to make asynchronous external calls to the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

1. Within your custom project, open the __YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__ workflow.

1. Click the __Copy__ button, provide a new name and select your custom package.

    Example:
    * __New Name:__ YOUR_CUSTOM_ASYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME
    * __Package:__ YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY
    
1. Close the design view of the __YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__ workflow and open the new __YOUR_CUSTOM_ASYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__ workflow.

1. Within the design view of the __YOUR_CUSTOM_ASYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__ workflow, change the process *Name*, *ID* and *Package* properties:

    * __Name:__ YOUR_CUSTOM_ASYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME
    * __ID:__ YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY.YOUR_CUSTOM_ASYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME
    * __Package:__ YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY

1. Ensure these process variables exist in the *Process Data* section of the *Process > Properties* editor:

    Name | Data Type | Target
    ---- | --------- | ------
    `destZip` | `String` | `destZip`
    `destTempMaxThreshold` | `Integer` | `destTempMaxThreshold`
    `openweatherAppId` | `String` | `openweatherAppId`

1. Ensure these class names exist in the *Imports > Data Type Imports* section of the *Process > Properties* editor:

    __Data Type Imports__
    
    Class Name |
    ---------- |
    `java.util.List` |
    `java.util.Map` |
    `java.util.LinkedHashMap` |
    `java.lang.Math` |
    
    __Tip:__
    > The [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) JSON parser is a provided dependency. If you wish to use `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` or any other class without the fully qualified class name in scripts, add the class to process data type imports.

1. From the *SubProcesses* section of the toolbar panel, drag the __Event__ sub-process onto the process design canvas.

    * Name the new sub-process: __Get Forecast Sub-process__.

1. From the *Start Events* section of the toolbar panel, drag the __Start Signal__ start event onto the process design canvas.

    * Place it within the boundaries of the new __Get Forecast Sub-process__.
    * Set a new `get_forecast` signal reference in the *Implementation/Execution > Signal* section of the start event properties editor.
    * Uncheck the `Is Interrupting` checkbox in the *Implementation/Execution* section of the start event properties editor.
    
        __NOTE:__
        > A non-interrupting start event does not stop or interrupt the execution of the containing or parent process.

1. Relocate the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task and set it to be asynchronous.
 
    * Place the task after the new __Start Signal__ start event within the boundaries of the __Get Forecast Sub-process__.
    * *Leave in place* the sequence flow existing from __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ (g1) to the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task.
    * *Remove* the sequence flow existing from the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task to __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ (g2).

    __Data Outputs and Assignments__
    
    Name | Data Type | Target
    ---- | --------- | ------
    `Result` | Custom ... `java.util.LinkedHashMap` | `forecastResult`
    
    * Ensure the following Java snippet exists in the __On Exit Action__ and that `java` is the currently selected language:
    
        ```
        Map _forecastResult = (Map) kcontext.getVariable("forecastResult");
        List<Map> forecastList = (List<Map>) _forecastResult.get("list");
        Integer _destTempMax = null;
        for (Map f : forecastList) {
            Map main = (Map) f.get("main");
            Object _tempMax = (main != null) ? main.get("temp_max") : null;
            Integer tempMax = (_tempMax != null) ? (int) Math.ceil(Double.parseDouble(_tempMax.toString())) : null;

            }
        }
        kcontext.setVariable("destTempMax", _destTempMax);
        ```

1. From the *Intermediate Events* section of the toolbar panel, drag a __Throwing Intermediate Signal__ event onto the process design canvas.

    * Place it at the original location of the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task.
    * Have the new __Throwing Intermediate Signal__ event send the `get_forecast` signal, with a signal scope of `Process Instance`.
    * Change the existing sequence flow from entering the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task to instead enter the new __Throwing Intermediate Signal__ event; starting at __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ (g1).

        * Ensure the *Implementation/Execution > Condition Expression* of the re-targeted sequence flow is using the following Java snippet:
            
            ```
            return kcontext.getVariable("destZip") != null && kcontext.getVariable("destTempMaxThreshold") != null;
            ```

1. From the *Intermediate Events* section of the toolbar panel, drag a __Catching Intermediate Signal__ event onto the process design canvas.

    * Place the event below the new __Throwing Intermediate Signal__ event, aligned with __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ (g2).
    * Set a new `forecast_received` signal reference in the *Implementation/Execution > Signal* section of the signal event properties editor.
	* Add a sequence flow from the __Throwing Intermediate Signal__ event to the new __Catching Intermediate Signal__ event.
    * Add a sequence flow from the new __Catching Intermediate Signal__ event to __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ (g2).

1. Complete implementation of the __Get Forecast Sub-process__:

    * Add a sequence flow from the *non-interrupting* __Start Event__ to the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task.
    * From the *Intermediate Events* section of the toolbar panel, drag a __Catching Intermediate Timer__ event onto the process design canvas. This will be used to simulate a delayed response.

        * Place the new timer event after the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task.
        * Set the following 30 second, ISO-8601 timer duration expression in the *Implementation/Execution > Timer Settings > Fire once after duration* section of the event properties editor:
                  
            ```

            ```

    * Add a sequence flow from the __Rest WorkItem Call Weather API__ task to the new timer event. 
    * Add a new __End Signal__ event after the new timer.
    * Have the new __End Signal__ event send the `forecast_received` signal, with a signal scope of `Process Instance`.
    * Add a sequence flow from the new timer to the new __End Signal__.

1. Use service response data as input to another step in the process.

    * Select the __Prepare for Shipment__ human task and open the task properties editor.
    * Open the *Implementation/Execution > Assignments* section of the task properties editor and ensure these data input assignments exist:
        
        __Prepare for Shipment Data I/O__
        
        __Data Inputs and Assignments__
        
        Name | Data Type | Source
        ---- | --------- | ------
        `destTempMaxForecast_In` | `Integer` | `destTempMax`
        `destTempMaxThreshold_In` | `Integer` | `destTempMaxThreshold`

    * These variables may now be used to populate corresponding form fields in a custom Kibo Fulfiller frontend.

1. Save your process changes and close the design view.

1. Deploy your custom project and test creating a new instance of process with ID: __YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY.YOUR_CUSTOM_ASYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__.

1. Once you have a new process instance created, advance the workflow to the __Print Packing Slip__ human task.

1. You will have 30 seconds to complete the following steps and see your process instance paused at the timer in the new sub-process:

    * Complete the __Print Packing Slip__ human task.
    * Navigate to the *Menu > Manage > Jobs* section of Business Central.
    * You should see a completed job of type `org.jbpm.process.core.async.AsyncSignalEventCommand`
    * Click the __View process__ action button for the job.
    * Once redirected to the *Manage Process Instances* section of Business Central, click your process instance entry to open a detailed view.
    * From the process instance detail view, select __Diagram__ and review the current state of workflow execution.
    * Refresh the view to see the flow continue after the 30-second timer has elapsed.
    * If the value of the `destTempMaxThreshold` process instance variable is greater than the value of `destTempMax`, the next active task should now be the __Prepare for Shipment__ task.
    * From the process instance detail view, select __Process Variables__ to review currently assigned variable values.
    
1. Start the __Prepare for Shipment__ task and notice the following data inputs:

    * __DestTempMaxForecast_In__: *value should match that of the `destTempMax` process instance variable*
    * __DestTempMaxThreshold_In__: *value should match that of the `destTempMaxThreshold` process instance variable*

# In a BPM workflow, signal to advance when stopped at a user task

This use case will illustrate how to move a process to the next step when stopped at a human user task using an external signal.

Refer the above diagram of process workflow and look for __Fulfullied Signal__.

Follow the steps to add Signal in workflow.

1. From the *Intermediate Events* section of the toolbar panel, need to drag a __Catching Intermediate Signal__ event onto the process design canvas.

	* Place the event below the __Diverging Parallel Gateway__, just after the __Pre-Accept Shipment User Task__.
    * Set a new `fulfilled` signal reference in the *Implementation/Execution > Signal* section of the signal event properties editor.
	* Add a sequence flow from the __Parallel Gateway__ event to the new __Catching Intermediate Signal__ event.
    * Add a sequence flow from the new __Catching Intermediate Signal__ event to __Diverging Exclusive Gateway__ which is placed before __Complete User Task__.
	
1. Save your process changes and close the design view.

1. Deploy your custom project and test creating a new instance of process with ID: __YOUR_DEVCENTER_ACCOUNT_KEY.YOUR_CUSTOM_SYNC_WORKFLOW_NAME__.

1. Once you have a new process instance created.

1. Navigate to the *Menu > Manage > Process Instances* section of Business Central.

	* Once redirected to the *Manage Process Instances* section of Business Central, click on __Actions option of your process instance.
	* From the Actions menu, select __Signal__ option.
	* Then __Signaling Process Instance__ window is opened. Pass __Signal__ Name as `fulfilled` and click on Signal button.
	* From the process instance detail view, select Diagram and review the current state of workflow execution. It is showing as __Completed__.
